# Cyber Suite
Just some tools I created for general attacks and reconnaissance using Python

## Usage
Run the following command to have my entire arsenal at your disposal

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

A custom prompt for the Cyber Suite is available using the `main.py`

```bash
python3 main.py
```

NOTE: This isn't updated too frequently and is really just some basic scripts I've built using Python that don't need a new repository
